// Pseudocode
// Main header is static
// Song guessed correctly prints when won and play the audio as well
// Print text saying "Press any Key to get started!"
// Next print wins and increment per win
// Print current word then dashes below that correspond to the length of the word 
// (letters appear here until word is guessed or # of guesses remaining are out) what happens at that point???
// If guessed print word & increment win counter
// Number of guesses remaining (start at 12 or 13 and decrement with each wrong guess)
// Letters Already Guessed
// Print letters typed (if same letter typed previously doesn't print here and doesn't decrease remaining)
// Left column has the picture of the band that they one with - changes with next win
